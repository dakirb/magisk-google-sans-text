# dakirb's Google Sans Text Font

## Why use dakirb's ##
This is a module to install Google Sans Text font systemlessly through Magisk. This uses the updated Google Sans Text Font, which I could not find in any module. I corrected this issue and now you have the updated Google Sans everywhere!

## Tested devices ##
* Google Pixel 7 - Android 14

## Known bugs ##
* none
